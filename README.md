## Usage

Be sure you have modestio repository copied to your machine.

### Using docker command line

First option is to run both postgres image and Django image as containers manually.

* Run a postgres image as a container first (from project's root directory) using the command:

```
docker run --name modestio-postgres --network modestio-network \
--hostname db --publish 5432:5432 \
--env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
--volume ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
postgres:latest
```

* Then build the Django image from Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t modestio:2023-03-10 .
```

* And run it as a container:

```
docker run --network modestio-network --publish 8000:8000 \
 --env DATABASE_HOST=db --volume .:/usr/src/app \
modestio:2023-03-10
```

### Using docker-compose file

It's more handy to use a docker-compose file. The only thing you need is to run the command:

```
docker compose up
```
